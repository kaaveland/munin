Requirements:

python 2.3 (it may run with earlier versions, but this is untested)
postgresql 8.1 (it may run with 8.0, but I'm pretty sure it won't run
on 7.x)
plpgsql 
a database (I haven't done any namespace stuff, but if you play around
with table names you could probably run it on a common DB.)
crontab
1GB drivespace for a full round. Usable with less if you remove old
tick information, but this might cause some breakage (for example with
old scans)

Install instructions:

0) Install pgsql, python, etc.
a) CREATE DATABASE yourdbnamehere WITH ENCODING = 'LATIN1';
b) find every reference to the old user and dbname in the config (muninrc) and 
correct them
c) Add the plpgsql language to your database. This usually requires
superuser access. It can either be done from the commandline with:

createlang plpgsql yourdbnamehere

Or in SQL when connected to the correct database with:

CREATE LANGUAGE plpgqsl

d) Fix user_table.sql to insert the correct superuser pnick (it's
currently commented out and set to jester).
e) \i user_table.sql and \i functions.sql
f) optional: insert stats (see below)
g) make sure the mods in the mod dir are the only ones you're
interested in using. 
h) copy muninrc-example to muninrc and update the values for your alliance
i) you should be set (though I've probably forgotten a bunch of
stuff).


Instructions for inserting stats (also found in howto_makestats.txt or use putships.py):

a) python utils/putships.py 
optionally) python utils/putships.py http://url.to/stats

optional) Set up the drupal instance to use the right db
